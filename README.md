# Niu-X2

Niu-X2 is a responsive theme for pelican, built with bootstrap3 and font-awesome. This
theme is implemented in a hurry and I am pretty new to bootstrap and jinja2, so the codes
look messy and may be bugy. If you find any bugs, please let me know.

## License

BSD 3-Clause License. Please see LICENSE.txt for more details.

## Demo

You can see my demo blog [atime.me](http://atime.me).

## Features

*  Bootstrap3.0.0 and font-awesome3.2.1 included.
*  Responsive(should be). 
*  Fixed position navigation bar.
*  Show toc(table of contents) on navigation bar with the [extract_headings](https://github.com/wilbur-ma/extract_headings) plugin, no addtional dependencies and no `[TOC]` in your markdown file. (Currently only markdown is supported)
*  Categories show in a dropdown menu on the header bar.
*  Pagination bar with customizable length. 
*  Tagcloud implemented with [tagcloud.js](https://code.google.com/p/tagcloud) which supports incremental search.
*  Collapsible monthly archives.
*  Define your own dropdown menu, footer links or footer icons through pelican configuration with font-awesome icons.
*  Category aliases, which should be useful when you set `USE_FOLDER_AS_CATEGORY` to `True`.

## TODO

1. Integrate google custom search into the theme.
2. Better readme.
